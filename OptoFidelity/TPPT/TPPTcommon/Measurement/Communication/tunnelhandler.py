class TunnelHandler(object):
    r"""Provides an interface to send and receive packages from socket.
    Reconnecting logic must be handled outside this class.

    Definitions:
        Packet: Contains the actual data.
                 Package is UTF-8 encoded string.
        Package: Contains the actual data (and length of the data).
                 The package format depends from protocol used.

    Protocol:
        Socket stream consists of packages. There is no data between packages.
        E.g. [package1][package2]...[packageN]

        Package contains the necessary information to read one package.
        Therefore it is possible to keep track of the package stream.

    Raises:
        IOError: When recv or send fails with error, this is raised.
                 After raise, new instance of this class must be created,
                 there is no going back. After IOError, if send_data() or
                 get_packet() are called, they should raise IOError again, but
                 there are no guarantees.
                 Note: IOError is not raised when recv timeouts.
        socket.timeout: When recv timeouts, socket.timeout is raised.

    Notes:
        This class does not take unicode as its arguments! Strings must
        be UTF-8 encoded bytestrings.
