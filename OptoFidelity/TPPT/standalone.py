"""
This module implements command-line interface for running TPPT scripts directly from Python interpreter
without TnT UI.
To run TPPT as standalone, use test parameters stored in dry_run_parameters.json.
This file has content identical to history.json. Assuming that the json file has entry
"test_parameters", start dry run by executing:
> python standalone.py "test_parameters"
Currently Python 3.5 32-bit / 64-bit is supported.
