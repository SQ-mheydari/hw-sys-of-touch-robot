Vimba Python API
===============

**For OptoFidelity purposes this package simply acts as a bundler and wrapper for Vimba C api.
If you need a driver for Allied Camera, please use OptoCamera-Allied instead of this package.**

Vimba Python API is contained in Allied Vision's Vimba Suite as of Vimba 4.0. Allied vision provides VimbaPython on GitHub additionally.   
Vimba runs on Windows, Linux, and ARM and also contains C, C++, and .NET APIs. Vimba contains extensive documentation and examples for each API.

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/alliedvision/VimbaPython and modified to bundle necessary .dll and .cti files during building.
This fork then loads the necessary files from the installed package instead of Vimba install location.


Building
===============
To build this package, you need:

1. Python version 3.7 or higher
2. [VimbaSDK](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software.html) for Window, Linux, or ARM. Please download the latest version. To install and use VimbaPython, please follow the instructions in the Vimba_x.x_VimbaPython folder you installed on your system.

The package can be built simply by running python setup.py bdist_wheel
