## Tip name

Tip name. Cannot contain spaces or special characters, underscores allowed. Cannot start with a number.

## Tip model

Tip model. Different models can have different set of parameters.

## Diameter

Tip touch surface diameter (mm).

## Offset x

Offset x (mm) measured from the robot head.

## Offset y

Offset y (mm) measured from the robot head.

## Length

Length (mm) measured from the robot head to the tip touch surface.

## Voice coil position

Position of the voice coils in millimeters when picking and dropping tip.

## Separation

Robot separation (mm) when multifinger is attached.

## Number of tips

Number of tips on the multifinger.

## Tip distance

Center-to-center distance (mm) between adjacent multifinger tips.

## First finger offset

Offset (mm) from the multifinger center to the first finger axis. Usually this is a multiple of Tip distance.

## Grippable

Is finger grippable with separation axis.

## Smart

Is tip a 'smart tip' that has a PCB for data storage?\n
Use of this feature requires specific hardware and may not be usable in all deliveries.\n
If smart tip can be used, it should be used because it can prevent collisions.

## Slot in

Robot position when tip is attached to robot and tip is in slot-in position.

## Slot out

Robot position when tip is attached to robot and tip is in slot-out position.

## Read data

Read tip properties from smart tip attached tool 1.

## Write data

Write tip properties to smart tip attached to tool 1.
